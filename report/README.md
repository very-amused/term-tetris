# CS202 Reports

This project is being written as a Spring 2024 final project for CS202 at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Reports in this folder are to satisfy arbitrary and tedious CS202 code report criteria, and are therefore likely to fall below the quality standards of `term-tetris` as a standalone project. If you are not Dr. Scott Emrich or one of his TAs, there is nothing of use in this folder for you.
